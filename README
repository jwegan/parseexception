Introduction:
    ParseException is a website designed to allow programmers to share their
knowledge. They can post up workarounds or solutions to difficult problems they
have encountered for the benefit of others. It can also be used to keep notes
or examples of how to execute certain commands or how to do something with a
particular API. 

Code:
    This is programmed using JSPs and the Apache Struts 1.3.10 framework. It is
necessary to run this within a sever capable of running Java servlets such as
Apache Tomcat. Furthermore a MySQL database is must be setup and the connection
information can be placed in the file application.properties in the root
directory of this project.
